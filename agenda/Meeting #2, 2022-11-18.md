- Keep track of meaningful SWISE buys/sells?
- Check correlation of events with TVL growth

**Updates about V3**
- Keep regular updates about new things happening in the V3 development (within what's possible)
- Even if the update is tiny/meaningless or people won't know much of what it means, regular annouccements, big announcements have a relationship with TVL

## SWAT tasks

**Trust wallet**
- Kickstart the task in a repo with the resources/assets (point 1 on the ["Connect your DApp to Trust Wallet"](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/connect-your-dapp-to-trust-wallet/100109) page)

**Open-ended task**
- Keep a space where people can propose new tasks and the bureau provides feedback regarding those tasks
- If a task is interesting/approved, we can set up a reward for its completion

**Bull cases for SWISE**
- team's model regarding SWISE bull case
- could be a kickstart to a post like this
- presenting scenarios where SWISE can be used in synergy with V3 and kind of the advantages of V3, because after all, SWISE represents StakeWise
- Regularly post on /biz/, r/ethfinance, r/ethstaker about SWISE?

**Tutorials/guides**
- Tutorials on how to use V3

**Comparisons between Rocket Pool and SW V3**
- Extensive comparison on how V3 could be potentially a more profitable product than rocketpool's minipools
- How to target the home staker market

**Bot for the stakewise bureau twitter acc**
- Regular updates to twitter, like a twitter bot that keeps track of deposits and changes in TVL
- Volume of the uniswap pool like trades back and forth, perhaps largest trades (above a certain threshold)
- % of stakewise marketshare in the beaconchain
- % APR for uni v3 pools as well as % APR for the staking pool updates

**Bot for telegram**
- Similar to twitter account, (Perhaps open source Woody's bot and add tasks to improve it?)

**Make a small site to keep track of V3 progress**
- Something like [wenmerge](https://wenmerge.com/)
