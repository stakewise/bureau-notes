# 1st Bureau meeting

Date: **2022, October 25**

- Bureau will have full autonomy. The team is here to support you, whatever you need just shout. 
- KPIs - preferable, but will be difficult for every single task. The bureau will ultimately have to decide if a qualitative task is being done to the acceptable standard.
- Marketing is a key piece - ETH Staker and ETH Finance are two key Reddit communities to target. Example SWAT task is for people to write a bull case for SWISE and distribute to those channels
- Another area is community growth/increased engagement, specifically on Discord. What are other communities doing to help drive engagement? And how could this be turned into a SWAT task?
- If you need things purchasing (domain name etc..), then just let us know and we can do it for you as a team. If you end up spending any gas on StakeWise-related items, please send over the txn IDs and we will reimburse you for the costs. 
- Some ideas for dev-based SWAT tasks are below: 

**Zapper DeFi**
Add StakeWise to Zapper https://zapper.fi/apps
Docs to do so are here- https://studio.zapper.fi/docs/tutorial/generate-your%20app

**Trust Wallet**
Add StakeWise to Trust Wallet DApp browser

**Ledger**
Brian already on this

**Forta**
Forta monitoring - currently used by Lido (https://app.forta.network/agents/lido) . Fully permissionless so can set up our own bots using their SDK. Or they have teams you can hire to develop bots: https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/what-is-forta/. Next steps: Dima to check whether this is something we want to pursue, if so, how do we want to do it. Dima build himself, hire a Forta team, SWAT?

**Galxe**
Add a StakeWise campaign for go-live. Users will be able to mint an NFT based on their involvement within V3. i.e. a specific NFT for node operators (different NFTs based on their score even), for Allocators who stake over X, over Y, over Z etc...

StakeWise V3 Motto
One thing we are missing as a protocol is a tag-line/motto, e.g. 'Just Do It' for Nike
I think it is an important piece of our brand that we want to hone, could be a good little task for the SWAT to drive this
